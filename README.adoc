is the *Application Performance Management* solution offering:

* Distributed Tracing (e.g. for microservices)
* Application Performance Management
* Business Transaction Management (currently only using JVM javaagent based approach)

Applications can be instrumented, using a non-intrusive Java agent approach for JVM based applications, or through
http://zipkin.io/pages/existing_instrumentations.html[Zipkin client libraries] (for polyglot environment).

In other words Hawkular APM provides the capabilities to monitor the flow of invocations
across servers, tiers, on-premises and in the cloud. It also enables detailed
performance analysis to be performed of the individual components that make up an
application.

== Build & Run

To build and run execute:

```shell
$ mvn clean install -Pdev -DskipTests [-Ptests]
$ dist/target/hawkular-apm-${version}/bin/standalone.sh [-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=1331]

-> go to http://localhost:[8080|9411]/ and log in with jdoe:password
```

The parameters to these commands are:

* `-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=1331` - deploy application on http://zipkin.io/[Zipkin] 9411 port. Default
 APM port is 8080.
* `-Pdev` - create user jdoe:password
* `-Ptests` - run integration tests

Add non-intrusive Java instrumentation to instrument your application
(https://hawkular.gitbooks.io/hawkular-apm-user-guide/content/installation/JVMAGENT.html[doc]):
```shell
$ source dist/target/hawkular-apm-dist-0.10.1.Final-SNAPSHOT/apm/setenv.sh <port>

-> restart your Java applications
```

== Documentation

Project documentation can be found link:https://hawkular.gitbooks.io/hawkular-apm-user-guide/content/[here].

REST API documentation can be generated using *-Pdocgen* profile. +
The doc is generated under *rest/target* folder.

```shell
$ mvn clean install -Pdocgen
```

== Project Structure

The project is divided into several areas:

[cols=">s,d"]
|=======================
| api |
This module contains the Java interfaces for services and processors, as well as +
the information model for exchanging business transaction information.
| client |
This folder contains the modules used to collector information from an execution environment.
| dist |
This module builds a distribution containing a pre-packaged Hawkular server with BTM installed.
| processors |
This folder contains the processor implementations that derive higher level information from the raw +
business transaction fragments reported by execution environments.
| server |
This folder contains the modules related to the server.
| tests |
This folder contains the integration tests.
| tools |
This folder contains the tools for working for APM.
| ui |
The angularjs based user interface.
